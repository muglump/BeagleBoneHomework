On the Sketch the 2nd to last toggles mods, and the last clears
LEDSwitch.c - takes eight arguments the first 4 are the gpio switches and the last 4 are the gpio leds. The switches map first argument to fifth argument and so forth. The switchs are set to both so the led will change both when switch is pushed and when the switch is released. 
Sketch2.c - takes 4 arguments the first is the x dimension of the 2d array, the 2nd the y  dimension of the 2d array. The third is the x coordinate of the starting position, and the fourth is the y coordinate of the starting position. The user types a character to change the board, w moves up, s down, a left, and d right. Additionally c resets the board to the orginal starting state, and r changes the write state. 
Sketch.c - takes 10 arguments the first is the c dimension of the 2d, the second is the y dimension of the 2d array. The 3rd and 4th arguments are the x and y starting position respectivly. The remaining 6 arguments are the gpio ports for the 6 switches. The first 5th through 8th arguments control the directional switches. The 9th argument toggles between either writing or erasing when the moved. The last argument clears the board when pressed, returning the board to its orginal state.
