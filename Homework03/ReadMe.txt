myi2cget.c - note, requires control c to terminate. Interrupts when the temp raises above 27 degrees Celsius. Takes 6 arguments the first 2 are the i2cbus. The third and fourth are the i2c addresses, and 5th and 6th are the registers that are being read from in this case the temp registers. The last 2 are the gpio pins for the alert. An example call based off the ones executed by me to test this are ./myi2cget 1 1 73 74 0 0 48 31.

matrixLED1ec - note, requres control c to terminate. Allows for the playing of etch-a-sketch on the 8x8 matrix. Takes 8 arguments for successful completion. The first 6 are the gpio pins that are used to get interrupts. The first four control the swicthes. The first moves up, second down, third right and fourth left. The remaining two take interrupts for the temp sensors, both are set with high and low to 27 degress Celsius. When triggered one will clear the board of all moves, the other will toggle between writing and reading. The last 2 arguments are the addreses of the chips.
